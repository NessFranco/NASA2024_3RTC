## 3 Raccoons in a Trench Coat

Welcome to the repository for "3 Raccoons in a Trench Coat" as we participate in the NASA Science App Challenge 2024! This repository serves as the central archive for all our work related to the challenge. Our team is dedicated to developing an innovative solution that aligns with NASA's mission to advance science and technology for the benefit of humanity.

## Purpose

- **Archival**: This repository will store all code, documents, and resources generated during the challenge. It will serve as a comprehensive record of our progress, ideas, and implementations.
- **Collaboration**: We aim to foster a collaborative environment where team members can contribute, review, and enhance each other's work.
- **Project Completion**: Ultimately, this repository will house the final version of our project, ready for submission to the NASA Science App Challenge 2024.
